I'm a CNRS researcher in the [SAFIR](https://icb.u-bourgogne.fr/safir/) team at [Laboratoire ICB](https://icb.u-bourgogne.fr/) (Dijon, France).

* Solitons, Dynamical systems and pattern formation
* Metrology

## Short Bio
I graduated from École Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France, X2009) and obtained a Master’s degree in Physics from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2014. I prepared [my PhD thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/3b911e88-b847-4260-998b-a85016eefd41/thesisdetails) in Tobias Kippenberg's lab at EPFL, focusing on the generation of low-noise optical frequency combs through nonlinear frequency conversion and Kerr soliton formation in micro-resonators, and defended it in 2019.

I then joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado as a postdoctoral researcher, where I developed methods for inverse design and optimization of frequency combs on micro-resonators.

I joined CNRS as a full-time researcher in 2022 and am now part of the photonics department at ICB. My research focuses on designing innovative photonic architectures in optical fibers or integrated photonics, to explore and control the influence of additional parameters on the shape and dynamics of optical combs. The ultimate goal is to tailor optical combs for targeted applications.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about photography. You can view my portfolio on [500px](https://500px.com/p/Erwan_Lucas?view=photos).  

## Collaborations
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, I am collaborating with Dr. *Scott B. Papp* on the dynamics of combs in photonic crystal ring resonators
- **The University Auckland**, with my colleague J. Fatome we are collaborating with the Laser Lab with Prof. *Stephane Coen*, Prof. *Miro Erkintalo* and Prof. *Stuart Murdoch*, in particular on polarization effects in fiber cavities and on nonlinear dynamics modeling in general.
- **Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY)**, I collaborate closely with the group of Prof. *Tobias Herr*, in the framework of the [M-Engine](/projects/M-Engine) Project
