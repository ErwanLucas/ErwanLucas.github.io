We are delighted to welcome Dr. Van Doan Le, who has joined our team as a Postdoc Researcher.

Dr. Le brings a strong background in meta-optics and advanced photonic simulations to our research group. His prior work included optimizing LEDs with engineered metasurfaces and studying the laser-induced optical properties of plasmonic nanomaterials.

Dr. Le's work will be dedicated to the Mengine project, focusing on the development of integrated comb sources for telecom applications. He will leverage his expertise in Silicon Photonic design and circuit simulations to realize these advanced devices.
We are excited for his contributions to photonics integration!

Welcome, Doan!
