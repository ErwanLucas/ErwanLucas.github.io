We are pleased to announce the arrival of Roseni Vences Robert, who has joined the SAFIR team as a PhD candidate.

Roseni will be contributing her expertise to our current research focused on refining and optimizing Kerr frequency combs.

Her PhD project is part of the ANR SMARTKOMBS initiative and is dedicated to customizing Kerr comb systems for specific light generation needs. Kerr combs are essential tools in fields such as precision measurement, telecommunications, and spectroscopy. Roseni's work will involve developing new experimental and numerical methods to engineer fiber cavities, aiming to achieve enhanced control over light generation and explore novel nonlinear dynamics.

We look forward to sharing her progress and the exciting results of this research.

A warm welcome to Roseni!
