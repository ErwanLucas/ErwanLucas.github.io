We are delighted to welcome Roseni Vences Robert, who has joined the SAFIR team as a PhD candidate. Roseni brings her passion for nonlinear optics and photonics to our ongoing efforts in advancing Kerr comb tailoring.

Her PhD project, funded through the ANR SMARTKOMBS initiative, focuses on customizing microcomb systems for tailored light generation. Microcombs, renowned for their applications in precision measurements, telecommunications, and spectroscopy, offer a rich playground for exploring fundamental and applied photonics. Roseni work will involve developing innovative experimental and numerical techniques to engineer microresonators, enabling unprecedented control over light generation and unveiling new nonlinear dynamics.

This ambitious project positions Roseni at the intersection of theory, computation, and experimentation, with the potential to deliver breakthroughs in microcomb technology.
Stay tuned for updates on her progress and the fascinating results from this research.

Welcome, Roseni!
