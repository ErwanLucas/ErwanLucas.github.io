3 years project funded by the European union's Innovation council (EIC Transition) aiming to develop a hybrid architecture of highly compact generic microcomb modules and establish their scalable fabrication using MTP processes.

ICB is involved in optimizing the microcomb's performances to meet the demanding criteria required for commercial applications.
