    abstract = "We report on numerical predictions and experimental observations of a novel type of temporal localized dissipative structures that manifest themselves in the self-defocusing regime of driven nonlinear optical resonators with two polarization modes. These chiral dissipative solitons, which we term “polarization faticons,” break both temporal and polarization symmetry and consist of two bright lobes of opposite polarization handedness, interlocked by a domain wall. Our study reveals that faticons are connected to a vectorial modulational instability, from which they can be excited through a collapsing dynamic. Faticons could offer a novel pathway for frequency comb generation in normal dispersion resonators. More generally, they offer new fundamental insights into vectorial localized dissipative structures and could be relevant to other multicomponent dissipative systems.",

    abstract = "Control of nonlinear interactions in microresonators enhances access to classical and quantum field states across nearly limitless bandwidth. A recent innovation has been to leverage coherent scattering of the intraresonator pump field as a control of group-velocity dispersion and nonlinear frequency shifts, which are precursors for the dynamical evolution of new field states. Yet, since nonlinear-resonator phenomena are intrinsically multimode and exhibit complex modelocking, here we demonstrate a new approach to controlling nonlinear interactions with bandgap modes completely separate from the pump laser. We explore this bandgap-detuned excitation regime through generation of benchmark optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and soliton microcombs. Indeed, we show that mode-locked states are phase matched more effectively in the bandgap-detuned regime in which we directly control the modal Kerr shift with the bandgaps without perturbing the pump field. In particular, bandgap-detuned excitation enables an arbitrary, mode-by-mode control of the backscattering rate as a versatile tool for mode-locked state engineering. Our experiments leverage nanophotonic resonators for phase matching of OPOs and solitons, leading to control over threshold power, conversion efficiency, and emission direction that enable application advances in high-capacity signaling and computing, signal generation, and quantum sensing.",

The comb’s properties depend crucially on the mismatch between the frequency spacing of the bichromatic pump and the free spectral range of the Brillouin laser cavity in both cases. Particularly, in the anomalous regime, adjusting this parameter yields coherent, stable frequency combs in the modulation instability regime. This allows control and expansion of the spectral bandwidth up to 2 THz in normal dispersion and to 6 THz under anomalous net dispersion.

    abstract = "Abstract Highly coherent frequency combs are of crucial importance for optical synthesis and metrology, spectroscopy, laser ranging, and optical communications. Kerr combs, generated via cascaded nonlinear frequency conversion in a passive optical cavity, typically offer high repetition rates, which is essential for some of these applications. Recently, new ways of generating Kerr combs combining Kerr and Brillouin effects have emerged with the aim of improving some performances, especially in the fiber cavity platform. Direct coherent pumping is replaced by lasing on specific cavity modes, offering easily adjustable repetition rates, and enhanced coherence by Brillouin purification. In this study, such a scheme is implemented and investigated in a non‐reciprocal cavity. Highly coherent combs are demonstrated by finely controlling bi‐chromatic Brillouin lasing and the Kerr comb parameters. A suitable numerical model is introduced to account for the interplay between Brillouin scattering, Kerr effect, and cavity resonant feedback. Quantitative agreements with experiments reveal the importance of the pump lasers detuning in setting the comb's properties, through the mode pulling effect. This phenomenon, along with multi‐mode lasing that impedes the coherence, is not studied in previous fiber‐based demonstrations. These limitations are discussed, and several scaling laws are devised.",

In optics, diverse families of continuous and discrete states arise from balance of nonlinearity and group-velocity dispersion (GVD). Moreover, the dichotomy of states with locally enhanced or diminished field intensity depends critically on the relative sign of nonlinearity and either anomalous or normal GVD. Here, we introduce a resonator with unconditionally normal GVD and a single defect mode that supports both dark, reduced-intensity states and bright, enhanced-intensity states. We access and explore this dark-to-bright pulse continuum by phase-matching with a photonic-crystal resonator, which mediates the competition of nonlinearity and normal GVD. These stationary temporal states are coherent frequency combs, featuring highly designable spectra and ultralow noise repetition-frequency and intensity characteristics. The dark-to-bright continuum illuminates physical roles of Kerr nonlinearity, GVD, and laser propagation in a gapped nanophotonic medium.",

Soliton microcombs have emerged as chip-scale, broadband and low-power-consumption frequency comb sources.Yet, integrated microcombs relying on thermal heaters for on-chip actuation all exhibit only kilohertz actuation bandwidth. Consequently, high-speed actuation and locking of microcombs have been attained only with off-chip bulk modulators. Here, we present high-speed microcomb actuation using integrated components. By monolithically integrating piezoelectric AlN actuators on ultralow-loss Si3N4 photonic circuits, we demonstrate voltage-controlled soliton tuning, modulation and stabilization. The integrated AlN actuators feature bi-directional tuning with high linearity and low hysteresis, operate with 300 nW power and exhibit flat actuation response up to megahertz frequency, significantly exceeding bulk piezo tuning bandwidth. We use this novel capability to demonstrate a microcomb engine for parallel FMCW LiDAR, via synchronously tuning the laser and microresonator. By applying a triangular sweep at the modulation rate matching the frequency spacing of HBAR modes, we exploit the resonant build-up of bulk acoustic energy to significantly lower the required driving to a CMOS voltage of only 7 Volts. Our approach endows soliton microcombs with integrated, ultralow-power-consumption, and fast actuation, significantly expanding the repertoire of technological applications.",

Having been observed in systems ranging from optical fibers to mode-locked lasers, they provide insights into the fundamental interactions between solitons and the underlying dynamics of the nonlinear systems. Here, we enter the multistability regime of a Kerr microresonator to generate superpositions of distinct soliton states that are pumped at the same optical resonance, and report the discovery of heteronuclear dissipative Kerr soliton molecules. Ultrafast electrooptical sampling reveals the tightly short-range bound nature of such soliton molecules, despite comprising dissipative Kerr solitons of dissimilar amplitudes, durations and carrier frequencies. Besides the significance they hold in resolving soliton dynamics in complex nonlinear systems, such heteronuclear soliton molecules yield coherent frequency combs whose unusual mode structure may find applications in metrology and spectroscopy.",

    abstract = "Coherent ranging, also known as frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) laser based ranging (LIDAR) is currently developed for long range 3D distance and velocimetry in autonomous driving. Its principle is based on mapping distance to frequency, and to simultaneously measure the Doppler shift of reflected light using frequency chirped signals, similar to Sonar or Radar. Yet, despite these advantages, coherent ranging exhibits lower acquisition speed and requires precisely chirped and highly-coherent laser sources, hindering their widespread use and impeding Parallelization, compared to modern time-of-flight (TOF) ranging that use arrays of individual lasers. Here we demonstrate a novel massively parallel coherent LIDAR scheme using a photonic chip-based microcomb. By fast chirping the pump laser in the soliton existence range of a microcomb with amplitudes up to several GHz and sweep rate up to 10 MHz, the soliton pulse stream acquires a rapid change in the underlying carrier waveform, while retaining its pulse-to-pulse repetition rate. As a result, the chirp from a single narrow-linewidth pump laser is simultaneously transferred to all spectral comb teeth of the soliton at once, and allows for true parallelism in FMCW LIDAR. We demonstrate this approach by generating 30 distinct channels, demonstrating both parallel distance and velocity measurements at an equivalent rate of 3 Mpixel/s, with potential to improve sampling rates beyond 150 Mpixel/s and increase the image refresh rate of FMCW LIDAR up to two orders of magnitude without deterioration of eye safety. The present approach, when combined with photonic phase arrays based on nanophotonic gratings, provides a technological basis for compact, massively parallel and ultra-high frame rate coherent LIDAR systems.",

    abstract = "The synthesis of low-noise microwave signals is of both scientific and technological relevance for timing, metrology, communications and radio-astronomy. Today, microwave signals with the lowest reported phase noise are produced by optical-frequency division using mode-locked laser frequency combs. However, this technique typically places stringent demands on the comb stabilisation. Moreover, previously-employed combs have repetition rates of few hundreds of megahertz, while the targeted frequencies lie around 10 GHz, requiring pulse interleaving methods. Here, a microresonator-based Kerr frequency comb (soliton microcomb) with a 14 GHz repetition rate is generated with an ultra-stable pump laser and used to derive an ultralow-noise microwave reference signal, with an absolute phase noise level below -60 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset frequency and -135 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, which constitute the lowest values synthesized with a microresonator to date. This is achieved using a novel transfer oscillator approach, where the free-running microcomb noise is cancelled via a combination of electronic division and mixing. The presented method opens new prospects for compact ultralow-noise microwave and sub-terahertz signal generators.",

Here, we report the observation of symmetry breaking in the group velocity of counter-propagating dissipative Kerr solitons, induced by polychromatic soliton Cherenkov radiation. Results show that in the presence of higher-order dispersion, the temporal arrangement of a multi-soliton state affects its group velocity, an effect which originates from the interference between multiple radiative tails emitted by individual solitons. Experimentally, we bidirectionally pump a microresonator with laser fields of equal power and frequency, and observe lifting of the degeneracy between the repetition rates of the counter-propagating solitons. The observation of symmetry breaking despite symmetric pumping conditions not only shines new light on the impact of dispersive waves on dissipative Kerr soliton dynamics, but also introduces a novel approach to develop coherent dual-comb spectrometers based on microcombs.",

Yet, electrically-driven, photonic chip-based microcombs are inhibited by the required high threshold power and the frequency agility of the laser for soliton initiation. Here we demonstrate an electrically-driven soliton microcomb by coupling a III–V-material-based (indium phosphide) multiple-longitudinal-mode laser diode chip to a high-Q silicon nitride microresonator fabricated using the photonic Damascene process. The laser diode is self-injection locked to the microresonator, which is accompanied by the narrowing of the laser linewidth, and the simultaneous formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. By tuning the laser diode current, we observe transitions from modulation instability, breather solitons, to single-soliton states. The system operating at an electronically-detectable sub-100-GHz mode spacing requires less than 1 Watt of electrical power, can fit in a volume of ca. 1 cm3, and does not require on-chip filters and heaters, thus simplifying the integrated microcomb.",

    abstract = "Dual-comb interferometry utilizes two optical frequency combs to map the optical field’s spectrum to a radio-frequency signal without using moving parts, allowing improved speed and accuracy. However, the method is compounded by the complexity and demanding stability associated with operating multiple laser frequency combs. To overcome these challenges, we demonstrate simultaneous generation of multiple frequency combs from a single optical microresonator and a single continuous-wave laser. Similar to space-division multiplexing, we generate several dissipative Kerr soliton states—circulating solitonic pulses driven by a continuous-wave laser—in different spatial (or polarization) modes of a MgF2 microresonator. Up to three distinct combs are produced simultaneously, featuring excellent mutual coherence and substantial repetition rate differences, useful for fast acquisition and efficient rejection of soliton intermodulation products. Dual-comb spectroscopy with amplitude and phase retrieval, as well as optical sampling of a breathing soliton, is realized with the free-running system. Compatibility with photonic-integrated resonators could enable the deployment of dual- and triple-comb-based methods to applications where they remained impractical with current technology.",

    abstract = {The observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators provides, on the applied side, compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs that have already been applied in coherent communications, dual comb spectroscopy and metrology. On a fundamental level, it enables the study of soliton physics in driven nonlinear cavities. Microresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode interactions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as "avoided mode crossings". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but can also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e.g. the formation of dispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing temporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied, but is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the discovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs within a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative solitons are expected. We demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon in two microresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic chip-based silicon nitride microresonators), and theoretically describe the dynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We demonstrate experimentally that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange between the soliton and another optical mode family. We further show that inter-mode interactions can be modeled by a response function acting on dissipative solitons. The observation of breathing dynamics in the conventionally stable soliton regime is critical to applications, ranging from low-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis to spectroscopy. On a fundamental level, our results provide new understandings of the rich dissipative soliton dynamics in multimode nonlinear cavities.},

    abstract = "Dissipative solitons are self-localised structures resulting from the double balance of dispersion by nonlinearity and dissipation by a driving force arising in numerous systems. In Kerr-nonlinear optical resonators, temporal solitons permit the formation of light pulses in the cavity and the generation of coherent optical frequency combs. Apart from shape-invariant stationary solitons, these systems can support breathing dissipative solitons exhibiting a periodic oscillatory behaviour. Here, we generate and study single and multiple breathing solitons in coherently driven microresonators. We present a deterministic route to induce soliton breathing, allowing a detailed exploration of the breathing dynamics in two microresonator platforms. We measure the relation between the breathing frequency and two control parameters—pump laser power and effective-detuning—and observe transitions to higher periodicity, irregular oscillations and switching, in agreement with numerical predictions. Using a fast detection, we directly observe the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual solitons, which provides evidence of breather synchronisation.",

    abstract = "Octave-spanning, self-referenced frequency combs are applied in diverse fields ranging from precision metrology to astrophysical spectrometer calibration. In the past decade, Kerr frequency comb generators have emerged as alternative scheme offering chip-scale integration, high repetition rate and bandwidths that are only limited by group velocity dispersion. The recent observation of Kerr frequency combs operating in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the means for fully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered spectral envelope. Here, by carefully optimizing the photonic Damascene fabrication process, and dispersion engineering of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Si\\_\{3\}N\\_\{4\}\}\$ microresonators with \$1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{THz\}\$ free spectral range, we achieve bandwidths exceeding one octave at low powers (\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mW\})\$) for pump lasers residing in the telecom C-band (\$1.55{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$), as well as for the first time in the O-band (\$1.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$). Equally important, we find that for THz repetition rate comb states, conventional criteria applied to identify DKS comb states fail. Investigating the coherence of generated, octave-spanning Kerr comb states we unambiguously identify DKS states using a response measurement. This allows to demonstrate octave-spanning DKS comb states at both pump laser wavelengths of \$1.3{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ and \$1.55{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ including the broadest DKS state generated to date, spanning more than \$200{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{THz\}\$ of optical bandwidth. Octave spanning DKS frequency combs can form essential building blocks for metrology or spectroscopy, and their operation at \$1.3{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ enables applications in life sciences such as Kerr comb based optical coherence tomography or dual comb coherent antistokes Raman scattering.",

    abstract = "Temporal-dissipative Kerr solitons are self-localized light pulses sustained in driven nonlinear optical resonators. Their realization in microresonators has enabled compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs as well as the study of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics is the effective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity resonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the soliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this relation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the effective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in microresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton width and detuning deviates by less than 1 \\% from the approximate expression, validating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent enhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between mode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution, and induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse repetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning. Finally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the soliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of the pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the approximate analytical solutions with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and provide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics.",

    abstract = "Self-referencing turns pulsed laser systems into self-referenced frequency combs. Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path toward the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date, self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber-based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum spanning two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference, the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser/'s frequency. This work demonstrates the principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.",

    abstract = {Dissipative temporal Kerr solitons in optical microresonators enable to convert a continuous wave laser into a train of femtosecond pulses. Of particular interest are single soliton states, whose \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{sech\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ spectral envelope provides a spectrally smooth and low noise optical frequency comb, and that recently have been generated in crystalline, silica, and silicon-nitride resonators. Here, we study the dynamics of multiple soliton states containing \$\{N\}\$ solitons and report the discovery of a novel, yet simple mechanism which makes it possible to reduce deterministically the number of solitons, one by one, i.e. \$\{N{\textbackslash}! {\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}! N{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!1{\textbackslash}! {\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}! {\textbackslash}dots {\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}! 1\}\$. By applying weak phase modulation, we directly characterize the soliton state via a double-resonance response. The dynamical probing demonstrates that transitions occur in a predictable way, and thereby enables us to map experimentally the underlying multi-stability diagram of dissipative Kerr solitons. These measurements reveal the "lifted" degeneracy of soliton states as a result of the power-dependent thermal shift of the cavity resonance (i.e. the thermal nonlinearity). The experimental results are in agreement with theoretical and numerical analysis that incorporate the thermal nonlinearity. By studying two different microresonator platforms (integrated \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Si\\_\{3\}N\\_\{4\}\}\$ microresonators and crystalline \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{MgF\\_\{2\}\}\$ resonators) we confirm that these effects have a universal nature. Beyond elucidating the fundamental dynamical properties of dissipative Kerr solitons the observed phenomena are also of practical relevance, providing a manipulation toolbox which enables to sequentially reduce, monitor and stabilize the number \$\{N\}\$ of solitons, preventing it from decay. Achieving reliable single soliton operation and stabilization in this manner in optical resonators is imperative to applications.},

By using a temporal dissipative single soliton state in an ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonator that is broadened in highly nonlinear fiber, an optical frequency comb is generated that is self-referenced, allowing us to phase coherently link a 190 THz optical carrier directly to a 14 GHz microwave frequency. Our work demonstrates that precision optical frequency measurements can be realized with compact high-Q microresonators.",

In this paper, a novel detection method is proposed. It is composed of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, the characteristic model of transmission towers is learned from a training set. The training set consists of images with known locations for all transmission towers. In the detection phase, meaningful image features are compared with the model in order to detect likely locations of transmission towers. Experimental results with images downloaded from the Internet show accurate detection even in the presence of background clutter and multiple objects.",

The quantum efficiency of this mechanism is extremely low (typically 10−9) but has a drastic influence on silicon devices harnessing two-photon absorption. We show that this linear photonic current decreases with temperature, displaying an activation energy similar to the dark current one. We show that this behaviour is consistent with a photo-assisted Shockley-Read mechanism in which the occupancy factor of a defect state in the Si band gap is influenced by the sub-band gap photon flux.",
